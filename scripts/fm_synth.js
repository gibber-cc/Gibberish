/**#Gibberish.FMSynth - Synth
Classic 2-op FM synthesis with an attached attack / decay envelope.
  
## Example Usage##
`Gibberish.init();  
a = new Gibberish.FMSynth({ cmRatio:5, index:3 }).connect();
a.note(880);`  
## Constructor   
**param** *properties*: Object. A dictionary of property values (see below) to set for the synth on initialization.

**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.frequency : property  
Number. The frequency for the carrier oscillator. This is normally set using the note method but can also be modulated.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.cmRatio : property  
Number. The carrier-to-modulation ratio. A cmRatio of 2 means that the carrier frequency will be twice the frequency of the modulator.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.attack : property  
Number. The length of the attack portion of the envelope in samples. Note that the synth's envelope affects both amplitude and the index of the synth.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.decay : property  
Number. The length of the decay portion of the envelope in samples. Note that the synth's envelope affects both amplitude and the index of the synth.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.glide : property  
Number. The synth has a one-pole filter attached to the carrier frequency. Set glide to a value between .999 and 1 to get pitch sweep between notes.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.amp : property  
Number. The relative amplitude level of the synth.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.channels : property  
Number. Default 2. Mono or Stereo synthesis.
**/
/**###Gibberish.FMSynth.pan : property  
Number. Default 0. If the synth has two channels, this determines its position in the stereo spectrum.

/**#Gibberish.PolyFM - Synth
A polyphonic version of [FMSynth](javascript:displayDocs('Gibberish.FMSynth'\)). There are two additional properties for the polyphonic version of the synth. The polyphonic version consists of multiple FMSynths being fed into a single [Bus](javascript:displayDocs('Gibberish.Bus'\)) object.
  
## Example Usage ##
`Gibberish.init();

a.note(880);  
a.note(1320);

## Constructor   
One important property to pass to the constructor is the maxVoices property, which defaults to 5. This controls how many voices are allocated to the synth and cannot be changed after initialization.
